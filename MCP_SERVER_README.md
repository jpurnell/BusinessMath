```

### Configuring Claude Desktop

Add the server to your Claude Desktop configuration file:

**macOS/Linux**: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "businessmath": {
      "command": "/Users/jpurnell/Dropbox/Computer/Development/Swift/Playgrounds/Math/BusinessMath/.build/arm64-apple-macosx/debug/businessmath-mcp-server",
      "args": []
    }
  }
}
```

**Note**: Update the path to match your actual build directory location.

### Verifying Installation

1. Restart Claude Desktop
2. Look for the MCP server icon (🔌) in Claude's interface
3. The BusinessMath server should appear in the list of available servers
4. You should see 43 tools available

## Usage Examples

Once configured, you can ask Claude to use these tools directly:

### Example 1: Calculate NPV for an Investment

```
User: I'm considering an investment that costs $100,000 upfront and will
generate $30,000 per year for 5 years. Using a 10% discount rate, what's
the NPV?
```

Claude will use the `calculate_npv` tool with:
- rate: 0.10
- cashFlows: [-100000, 30000, 30000, 30000, 30000, 30000]

### Example 2: Calculate Loan Payments

```
User: What would my monthly payment be on a $350,000 mortgage at 6.5%
annual interest for 30 years?
```

Claude will use the `calculate_payment` tool with:
- presentValue: 350000
- rate: 0.065/12 (monthly rate)
- periods: 360 (30 years * 12 months)
- type: "ordinary"

### Example 3: Calculate CAGR

```
User: My investment grew from $50,000 to $125,000 over 8 years.
What was the compound annual growth rate?
```

Claude will use the `calculate_cagr` tool with:
- beginningValue: 50000
- endingValue: 125000
- periods: 8

### Example 4: Revenue Forecasting with Seasonality

```
User: I have quarterly sales data for 2022-2024. Can you forecast 2025
sales accounting for seasonal patterns?
```

Claude will:
1. Create a time series with `create_time_series`
2. Calculate seasonal indices with `calculate_seasonal_indices`
3. Decompose the data with `decompose_time_series`
4. Create forecast with `forecast_with_seasonality`

### Example 5: Loan Amortization Schedule

```
User: Show me the full amortization schedule for a $250,000 mortgage
at 6.75% for 30 years with monthly payments.
```

Claude will use `create_amortization_schedule` with showFullSchedule option.

### Example 6: Cost of Capital Analysis

```
User: Calculate WACC for a company with $500M equity (12% cost),
$300M debt (5% cost), and 25% tax rate.
```

Claude will use `calculate_wacc` to determine the weighted average cost
of capital.

### Example 7: Statistical Analysis

```
User: I have advertising spend and revenue data. Is there a correlation
between them? Can you build a regression model?
```

Claude will:
1. Use `calculate_correlation` to measure the relationship strength
2. Apply `linear_regression` to build a predictive model
3. Calculate R² to assess goodness of fit

### Example 8: Monte Carlo Simulation

```
User: I'm planning a project with uncertain costs ($800K-$1.2M, most likely $1M)
and revenues (normally distributed, mean $1.5M, std dev $200K). What's the
probability of making a profit? What's the worst-case scenario at 95% confidence?
```

Claude will:
1. Use `create_distribution` to set up triangular (costs) and normal (revenue) distributions
2. Run `run_monte_carlo` with calculation "revenue - costs" for 10,000 iterations
3. Use `calculate_probability` to find P(profit > 0)
4. Apply `calculate_value_at_risk` to determine the 95% VaR

### Example 9: Sensitivity Analysis

```
User: My profit formula is Revenue - Costs - Marketing. Revenue is $1M,
Costs are $600K, Marketing is $100K. Which variable has the biggest impact
if they each vary by ±20%?
```

Claude will use `tornado_analysis` to rank variables by their impact on profit.

## Architecture

### Components

- **MCPProtocol.swift** - JSON-RPC 2.0 and MCP protocol types
- **StdioTransport.swift** - stdio-based message transport
- **MCPServer.swift** - Main server implementation
- **ToolRegistry.swift** - Tool registration and execution
- **TypeMarshalling.swift** - JSON ↔ Swift type conversion
- **Tools/** - Individual tool implementations

### Extending the Server

To add new tools:

1. Create a new struct implementing `MCPToolHandler`:

```swift
public struct MyNewTool: MCPToolHandler, Sendable {
    public let tool = MCPTool(
        name: "my_new_tool",
        description: "Description of what the tool does",
        inputSchema: MCPToolInputSchema(
            properties: [
                "param1": MCPSchemaProperty(
                    type: "number",
                    description: "First parameter"
                )
            ],
            required: ["param1"]
        )
    )

    public init() {}

    public func execute(arguments: [String: AnyCodable]?) async throws -> MCPToolCallResult {
        guard let args = arguments else {
            throw ToolError.invalidArguments("Missing arguments")
        }

        let param1 = try args.getDouble("param1")

        // Perform calculation using BusinessMath library
        let result = someBusinessMathFunction(param1)

        return .success(text: "Result: \(result)")
    }
}
```

2. Add tool to the server in `main.swift`:

```swift
await server.registerTool(MyNewTool())
```

3. Rebuild: `swift build`

## Troubleshooting

### Server Won't Start

1. **Check build**: Ensure `swift build` completes without errors
2. **Check path**: Verify the executable path in `claude_desktop_config.json`
3. **Check permissions**: Ensure the executable has execute permissions
   ```bash
   chmod +x .build/arm64-apple-macosx/debug/businessmath-mcp-server
   ```

### Tools Not Appearing

1. **Restart Claude Desktop** completely
2. **Check logs**: Look in Claude Desktop's developer console
3. **Verify configuration**: Ensure JSON is valid in config file

### Tool Execution Errors

- Check the error message returned by the tool
- Common issues:
  - Wrong parameter types (e.g., string instead of number)
  - Missing required parameters
  - Invalid period specifications in time series
