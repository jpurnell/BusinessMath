### Quick Start with MCP Server

**Using Claude Desktop** (Recommended - stdio mode):

1. Build the server:
```bash
swift build -c release
```

2. Configure Claude Desktop (`~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`):
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "businessmath": {
      "command": "/path/to/BusinessMath/.build/release/businessmath-mcp-server"
    }
  }
}
```

3. Restart Claude Desktop and start using natural language:
   - "Calculate the NPV of an investment with initial cost $100,000 and annual returns of $30,000 for 5 years at 10% discount rate"
   - "Run a Monte Carlo simulation with 10,000 iterations for a revenue model with normal distribution (mean: $1M, stddev: $200K)"
   - "Create a 30-year amortization schedule for a $300,000 loan at 6% interest"
   - "Optimize a portfolio across 3 assets to maximize Sharpe ratio"
   - "Calculate VaR at 95% confidence for my portfolio returns"
   - "Price a Black-Scholes call option with spot $100, strike $105, 6 months to expiry"
   - "Run a stress test on baseline revenue of $10M and costs of $7M using a recession scenario"

**HTTP Mode** (Experimental):
```bash
.build/release/businessmath-mcp-server --http 8080
```

See [HTTP_MODE_README.md](HTTP_MODE_README.md) for details and limitations. HTTP mode is experimental; stdio mode is recommended for production use.

## Installation

### Swift Package Manager

Add BusinessMath to your `Package.swift`:

```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/yourusername/BusinessMath.git", from: "1.0.0")
]
```

Or in Xcode: **File** → **Add Package Dependencies** → Enter repository URL

## Quick Start

### Time Series Analysis

```swift
import BusinessMath

// Create monthly revenue time series
let periods = [
    Period.month(year: 2024, month: 1),
    Period.month(year: 2024, month: 2),
    Period.month(year: 2024, month: 3)
]
let revenue: [Double] = [100_000, 120_000, 115_000]

let ts = TimeSeries(periods: periods, values: revenue)

// Calculate growth rate
let growth = ts.growthRate(lag: 1)
print(growth.valuesArray)  // [0.20, -0.042]

// Moving average
let smoothed = ts.movingAverage(window: 2)
```

### Financial Calculations

```swift
// Calculate monthly mortgage payment
let payment = payment(
    presentValue: 300_000,    // Loan amount
    rate: 0.06 / 12,          // Monthly rate (6% annual)
    periods: 360,              // 30 years
    futureValue: 0,
    type: .ordinary
)
// Result: ~$1,799/month

// Evaluate an investment
let cashFlows = [-100_000.0, 30_000, 40_000, 50_000, 60_000]

let npv = npv(discountRate: 0.10, cashFlows: cashFlows)
// Result: ~$37,908 (positive → good investment)

let irr = try irr(cashFlows: cashFlows)
// Result: ~28.7% return
```

### Revenue Forecasting

```swift
// Historical data with seasonality
let historical = TimeSeries(periods: historicalPeriods, values: historicalRevenue)

// 1. Extract seasonal pattern
let seasonalIndices = try seasonalIndices(timeSeries: historical, periodsPerYear: 4)

// 2. Deseasonalize
let deseasonalized = try seasonallyAdjust(timeSeries: historical, indices: seasonalIndices)

// 3. Fit trend model
var trend = LinearTrend<Double>()
try trend.fit(to: deseasonalized)

// 4. Project forward
let trendForecast = try trend.project(periods: 4)

// 5. Reapply seasonality
let forecast = try applySeasonal(timeSeries: trendForecast, indices: seasonalIndices)
```

## Examples

### Loan Amortization Schedule

```swift

let rate = 0.06 / 12
let periods = 360

let monthlyPayment = payment(presentValue: principal, rate: rate, periods: periods, futureValue: 0, type: .ordinary)

// Analyze specific payment
let payment1Interest = interestPayment(rate: rate, period: 1, totalPeriods: periods, presentValue: principal, futureValue: 0, type: .ordinary)
let payment1Principal = principalPayment(rate: rate, period: 1, totalPeriods: periods, presentValue: principal, futureValue: 0, type: .ordinary)

// First payment: ~$1,500 interest, ~$299 principal
```

### Investment with Irregular Cash Flows

```swift
let dates = [
    Date(),  // Today
    Date(timeIntervalSinceNow: 100 * 86400),  // 100 days
    Date(timeIntervalSinceNow: 250 * 86400),  // 250 days
    Date(timeIntervalSinceNow: 400 * 86400)   // 400 days
]
let cashFlows = [-100_000.0, 30_000, 50_000, 40_000]

let xnpvValue = try xnpv(rate: 0.10, dates: dates, cashFlows: cashFlows)
let xirrValue = try xirr(dates: dates, cashFlows: cashFlows)
```

### Seasonal Revenue Pattern

```swift
// Quarterly revenue with Q4 spike
let quarters = (0..<12).map { Period.quarter(year: 2022 + $0/4, quarter: ($0 % 4) + 1) }
let revenue: [Double] = [100, 120, 110, 150, 105, 125, 115, 160, 110, 130, 120, 170]

let ts = TimeSeries(periods: quarters, values: revenue)

// Calculate seasonal indices
let indices = try seasonalIndices(timeSeries: ts, periodsPerYear: 4)
// Result: [~0.84, ~1.01, ~0.93, ~1.22]
// Q1: 16% below average, Q4: 22% above average (holiday spike)
```
