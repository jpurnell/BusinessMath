## What We Accomplished This Session

### ðŸŽ‰ Released v1.7.0: Financial Statements
Complete implementation of three major financial statements with multi-company support:

1. **Entity System**
   - Flexible identifier system (ticker, CUSIP, ISIN, LEI, internal, taxId, custom)
   - Alternative identifiers dictionary
   - Fiscal year end support
   - Metadata for categorization

2. **Account System**
   - Combines Entity + AccountType + TimeSeries
   - Validation and metadata support
   - Codable, Equatable, Hashable

3. **Income Statement**
   - Revenue/expense aggregation
   - All profitability metrics (gross profit, EBITDA, net income)
   - Margin calculations
   - Materialization for performance

4. **Balance Sheet**
   - Asset/liability/equity accounts
   - Accounting equation validation
   - Current/non-current classification
   - Financial ratios (current ratio, debt-to-equity, equity ratio)
   - Working capital calculations

5. **Cash Flow Statement**
   - Operating/investing/financing categories
   - Free cash flow calculation
   - Net cash flow tracking

### ðŸ“Š Test Coverage
- **95 comprehensive tests** following TDD
- Entity tests: 18
- Account tests: 23
- Income Statement tests: 19
- Balance Sheet tests: 19
- Cash Flow Statement tests: 16

### ðŸ”§ Technical Improvements
- TimeSeries arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /)
- TimeSeries Codable conformance
- Sendable conformance for Swift Concurrency
- Value types (structs) for scalability
- All metrics public for cross-company analysis

### ðŸ“¦ Git Status
- **Commit:** 396ca2a + 1759096 (MASTER_PLAN update)
- **Tag:** v1.7.0 (pushed to GitHub)
- **Branch:** main
- All changes committed and pushed

## ðŸŽ¯ Next Steps: Topic 4 - Scenario & Sensitivity Analysis

When you resume, start with:

1. **Review the updated MASTER_PLAN.md**
   - Location: `Time Series/00_MASTER_PLAN.md`
   - Section: "RESUME HERE: Next Steps for Topic 4"

2. **Key Design Questions to Discuss**
   - Scenario override strategy (how to modify drivers)
   - Integration with existing DriverProjection
   - API design for sensitivity analysis
   - Performance considerations (parallelization?)

3. **Proposed Implementation Order (TDD)**
   - Scenario structure and tests
   - ScenarioRunner implementation
   - SensitivityAnalysis with tests
   - Monte Carlo financial simulation integration
   - Risk metrics (VaR, CVaR)

4. **Files to Create**
   ```
   Sources/BusinessMath/Scenario Analysis/
   â”œâ”€â”€ Scenario.swift
   â”œâ”€â”€ ScenarioRunner.swift
   â”œâ”€â”€ FinancialProjection.swift
   â”œâ”€â”€ SensitivityAnalysis.swift
   â”œâ”€â”€ FinancialSimulation.swift
   â””â”€â”€ RiskMetrics.swift
   ```

## ðŸ”„ Development Workflow Preferences

Based on this session:

1. **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**
   - Always write tests first
   - Then implement to pass tests

2. **Public APIs**
   - Make metrics public for cross-company analysis
   - Use materialization pattern when performance is critical

3. **Value Types**
   - Prefer structs over classes
   - Sendable conformance for concurrency

4. **Validation**
   - Validate in initializers
   - Throw descriptive errors

5. **Documentation**
   - DocC-style comments
   - Include usage examples
   - Document design decisions

---

## Quick Resume Checklist

When starting next session:

- [ ] Read `Time Series/00_MASTER_PLAN.md` (section "RESUME HERE")
- [ ] Review this SESSION_SUMMARY
- [ ] Check git status to confirm clean state
- [ ] Run tests to verify all passing: `swift test`
- [ ] Discuss design questions for Topic 4
- [ ] Start with TDD: write tests for Scenario first
- [ ] Follow implementation order in MASTER_PLAN

## Context Preservation

All key decisions, progress, and next steps have been documented in:

1. **00_MASTER_PLAN.md** - Comprehensive roadmap with detailed next steps
2. **This SESSION_SUMMARY** - Quick reference for what was just completed
3. **Git history** - All code changes committed with descriptive messages
4. **Git tags** - v1.7.0 marks this milestone

You can resume at any time without loss of context by reading the MASTER_PLAN.
