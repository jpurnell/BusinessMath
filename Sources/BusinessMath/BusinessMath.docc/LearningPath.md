# Recommended Learning Path

A guided journey through BusinessMath from beginner to expert.

## Overview

The BusinessMath documentation contains 44 guides covering everything from basic time series to advanced optimization. While you can jump directly to topics that interest you, this learning path provides a structured curriculum that builds knowledge progressively.

Think of this as a "read cover-to-cover" guide. We've organized the documentation like a book with five parts, but within those parts, some chapters make more sense when read in sequence. This guide shows you the optimal reading order for comprehensive mastery.

## Who Should Use This Guide?

This learning path is ideal if you:
- Are new to BusinessMath and want systematic introduction
- Prefer structured learning over random exploration
- Want to ensure you're not missing fundamental concepts
- Are building expertise for a professional role

If you already know what you need, feel free to jump directly to relevant topics using the part-based organization.

**2. Modify Examples**: After completing an example, change the inputs. What happens? Why?

**3. Build Projects**: Apply concepts to real problems from your work. This cements understanding.

**4. Review Prerequisites**: Each guide lists prerequisites. If you're struggling, review those first.

**5. Use Checkpoints**: We've included checkpoints after each phase. Complete these before moving forward.

### Time Management

**Intensive Study**: 2-3 hours daily, 1-2 weeks for a complete track

**Part-Time Learning**: 30-60 minutes daily, 4-6 weeks for a complete track

**Just-In-Time**: Jump directly to topics you need, bookmark for later reference
