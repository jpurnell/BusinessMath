import Foundation

/// Represents a debt instrument (loan, bond, etc.) with payment schedule generation.
///
/// `DebtInstrument` models various types of debt with different amortization structures:
/// - Level payment (constant total payment, like mortgages)
/// - Straight line (equal principal payments, declining interest)
/// - Bullet payment (interest-only with principal at maturity)
/// - Custom payment schedules
///
/// ## Overview
///
/// Use this type to model loans, bonds, and other debt instruments with scheduled payments.
/// The instrument generates a complete amortization schedule showing how principal and interest
/// are allocated over time.
///
/// ## Usage Example
///
/// ```swift
/// // Create a 30-year mortgage
/// let mortgage = DebtInstrument(
///     principal: 250_000.0,
///     interestRate: 0.045,
///     startDate: Date(),
///     maturityDate: Calendar.current.date(byAdding: .year, value: 30, to: Date())!,
///     paymentFrequency: .monthly,
///     amortizationType: .levelPayment
/// )
///
/// let schedule = mortgage.schedule()
/// print("Monthly payment: $\(schedule.payment[schedule.periods.first!]!)")
/// print("Total interest: $\(schedule.totalInterest)")
/// ```
