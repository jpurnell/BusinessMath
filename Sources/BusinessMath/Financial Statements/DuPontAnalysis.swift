// MARK: - DuPont Analysis

/// DuPont Analysis - ROE decomposition to understand drivers of profitability.
///
/// DuPont Analysis breaks down Return on Equity (ROE) into component ratios to identify
/// whether ROE is driven by profitability, efficiency, or leverage. This helps investors
/// and analysts understand the quality and sustainability of returns.

// MARK: - 3-Way DuPont Analysis

/// Result of 3-way DuPont Analysis decomposition.
///
/// The 3-way DuPont formula decomposes ROE into three components:
///
/// ```
/// ROE = Net Margin × Asset Turnover × Equity Multiplier
/// ```
///
/// ## Components
///
/// - **Net Margin** (Profitability): How much profit the company generates per dollar of sales
/// - **Asset Turnover** (Efficiency): How efficiently the company uses assets to generate sales
/// - **Equity Multiplier** (Leverage): How much the company relies on debt financing
///
/// ## Interpretation
///
/// - **High Net Margin**: Company has pricing power or cost advantages
/// - **High Asset Turnover**: Company efficiently uses assets (common in retail)
/// - **High Equity Multiplier**: Company uses leverage (higher risk, higher return potential)
///
/// ## Business Model Implications
///
/// - **Luxury goods**: High margin, low turnover, low leverage
/// - **Retail**: Low margin, high turnover, moderate leverage
/// - **Banks**: Moderate margin, low turnover, high leverage
///
/// ## Example
///
/// ```swift
/// let dupont = dupontAnalysis(
///     incomeStatement: incomeStatement,
///     balanceSheet: balanceSheet
/// )
///
/// let q1 = Period.quarter(year: 2025, quarter: 1)
/// print("Net Margin: \(dupont.netMargin[q1]! * 100)%")
/// print("Asset Turnover: \(dupont.assetTurnover[q1]!)")
/// print("Equity Multiplier: \(dupont.equityMultiplier[q1]!)")
/// print("ROE: \(dupont.roe[q1]! * 100)%")
/// ```

/// Performs 3-way DuPont Analysis to decompose ROE into profitability, efficiency, and leverage.
///
/// The DuPont formula shows that ROE can be improved by:
/// 1. Increasing profit margins (better pricing or cost control)
/// 2. Increasing asset turnover (more efficient use of assets)
/// 3. Increasing leverage (higher equity multiplier, but also higher risk)
///
/// ## Formula
///
/// ```
/// ROE = Net Margin × Asset Turnover × Equity Multiplier
///
/// Net Margin = Net Income / Revenue
/// Asset Turnover = Revenue / Average Assets
/// Equity Multiplier = Average Assets / Average Equity
/// ```
///
/// ## Use Cases
///
/// - **Compare companies**: Understand why one company has higher ROE
/// - **Track trends**: See which component drives ROE changes over time
/// - **Strategy**: Identify which lever to pull to improve ROE
///
/// ## Example
///
/// ```swift
/// let dupont = dupontAnalysis(
///     incomeStatement: incomeStatement,
///     balanceSheet: balanceSheet
/// )
///
/// // Company A: High ROE from margins (luxury brand)
/// // Company B: High ROE from turnover (discount retailer)
/// // Company C: High ROE from leverage (bank)
/// ```

///   - incomeStatement: The company's income statement
///   - balanceSheet: The company's balance sheet
/// - Returns: DuPontAnalysis struct with all components

// MARK: - 5-Way DuPont Analysis

/// Result of 5-way DuPont Analysis decomposition.
///
/// The 5-way DuPont formula provides a more detailed decomposition, separating
/// operating performance from financing decisions:
///
/// ```
/// ROE = Tax Burden × Interest Burden × Operating Margin × Asset Turnover × Equity Multiplier
/// ```
///
/// ## Components
///
/// - **Tax Burden**: Retention rate after taxes (Net Income / EBT)
/// - **Interest Burden**: Impact of interest expense (EBT / EBIT)
/// - **Operating Margin**: Operating profitability (EBIT / Revenue)
/// - **Asset Turnover**: Asset efficiency (Revenue / Assets)
/// - **Equity Multiplier**: Financial leverage (Assets / Equity)
///
/// ## Operating vs Financing
///
/// The 5-way analysis separates:
/// - **Operating performance**: Operating Margin × Asset Turnover
/// - **Financing impact**: Tax Burden × Interest Burden × Equity Multiplier
///
/// ## When to Use
///
/// Use 5-way analysis when:
/// - Comparing companies with different capital structures
/// - Analyzing impact of debt on returns
/// - Evaluating operating performance independent of financing
///
/// ## Example
///
/// ```swift
/// let dupont5 = dupontAnalysis5Way(
///     incomeStatement: incomeStatement,
///     balanceSheet: balanceSheet
/// )
///
/// // Operating ROA = Operating Margin × Asset Turnover
/// let operatingROA = dupont5.operatingMargin[q1]! * dupont5.assetTurnover[q1]!
///
/// // Impact of financing decisions
/// let financingMultiplier = dupont5.taxBurden[q1]! *
///                          dupont5.interestBurden[q1]! *
///                          dupont5.equityMultiplier[q1]!

///
/// ## Interpretation
///
/// - **Tax Burden < 1**: Company pays taxes (typical)
