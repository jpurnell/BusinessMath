	// MARK: - The variance, when we have the entire population of values and not a sample, is the Sum of Squared Average Difference, averaged over the total number of observations
/**
 Computes the population variance for a given set of values.

 The population variance is a measure of the dispersion of a set of data points. It is calculated as the sum of squared differences from the mean divided by the number of data points.

 - Parameters:
	- values: An array of values for which the population variance is to be calculated.

 - Returns: The population variance of the given dataset.

 - Note:
   - This function uses the formula `σ^2 = Σ((x - μ)^2) / n`, where `n` is the number of data points and `μ` is the mean of the dataset.
   - The function `sumOfSquaredAvgDiff(_:)` is assumed to be defined elsewhere, which computes the sum of squared differences from the mean.

 - Requires:
   - Implementation of the `sumOfSquaredAvgDiff(_:)` function to compute the necessary sum of squared differences.

 - Example:
   ```swift
   let data: [Double] = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0]
   let populationVariance = varianceP(data)
   print("Population variance of the data: \(populationVariance)")
   ```

 - Important:
   - Ensure that the `values` array is not empty to perform meaningful variance computation.
   - Equivalent of Excel VARP(xx:xx)
