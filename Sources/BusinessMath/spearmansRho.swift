/**
 Computes Spearman's rank correlation coefficient (rho) for two datasets.

 Spearman's rank correlation coefficient is a nonparametric measure of rank correlation (statistical dependence between the rankings of two variables). It assesses how well the relationship between two variables can be described using a monotonic function.

 - Parameters:
	- independent: An array of independent values to be ranked and compared.
	- variable: An array of dependent values to be ranked and compared.

 - Returns: Spearman's rank correlation coefficient (rho) for the given datasets.

 - Note:
   - This function assumes the existence of the `rank()` and `tauAdjustment()` methods for the arrays of type `[T]`. These methods should compute the ranks of the elements in the array and the tie adjustments respectively.
   - Ensure that both input arrays have the same length to calculate the correlation coefficient meaningfully.

 - Requires:
   - Implementation of the `rank()` method for arrays to compute ranks of values.
   - Implementation of the `tauAdjustment()` method for arrays to adjust for ties in the ranking.

 - Example:
   ```swift
   let xVals: [Double] = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
   let yVals: [Double] = [15, 25, 35, 45, 55]
   let rho = spearmansRho(xVals, vs: yVals)
   print("Spearman's rank correlation coefficient: \(rho)")
   ```

 - Important:
   - Ensure that `independent` and `variable` arrays have the same length.
   - Ensure that both arrays are not empty to avoid computation errors.
   - Ensure that the `rank()` and `tauAdjustment()` methods are correctly implemented for the computations.
