## Notes & Decisions

### Decision Log

**Date:** October 15, 2025 (Morning)
**Decision:** Use Swift Testing framework instead of XCTest
**Rationale:** Modern, cross-platform, better ergonomics with `@Test` and `#expect`

**Date:** October 15, 2025 (Morning)
**Decision:** Use DocC for all documentation
**Rationale:** First-party tool, excellent integration, web export capability

**Date:** October 15, 2025 (Morning)
**Decision:** Period uses Date internally
**Rationale:** Precise, handles calendar complexities, integrates with Foundation

**Date:** October 15, 2025 (Afternoon)
**Decision:** Remove weekly period type, use only daily/monthly/quarterly/annual
**Rationale:** Domain expert feedback - weekly not commonly used in financial models

**Date:** October 15, 2025 (Afternoon)
**Decision:** Use Double precision for all conversions, not Int
**Rationale:** Financial accuracy critical - "extra day can make a big difference" for oil production, etc.

**Date:** October 15, 2025 (Afternoon)
**Decision:** Use actual days (365.25/12 = 30.4375) not approximations (30 days)
**Rationale:** Domain expert requirement for precision in revenue calculations

**Date:** October 15, 2025 (Afternoon)
**Decision:** Default tolerance of 0.0001 for floating point comparisons
**Rationale:** Balance between precision and practical testing; can be adjusted per test

**Date:** October 15, 2025 (Late Afternoon)
**Decision:** Fiscal year support via FiscalCalendar (Phase 1.4), not in Period struct
**Rationale:** Separation of concerns - Period handles calendar dates, FiscalCalendar maps to fiscal periods. Allows supporting multiple fiscal year-ends (e.g., Apple's Sept 30).

**Date:** October 15, 2025 (Late Afternoon)
**Decision:** Compact labels by default with custom formatting option
**Rationale:** Compact format ("2025-01", "2025-Q1") is machine-readable and concise. DateFormatter support provides flexibility for user-facing displays.

**Date:** October 15, 2025 (Late Afternoon)
**Decision:** End dates are last second of period (23:59:59), not last millisecond
**Rationale:** Standard practice in financial systems; sufficient precision for business purposes.

**Date:** October 15, 2025 (Late Afternoon)
**Decision:** Daily periods cannot subdivide into months/quarters
**Rationale:** Logical constraint - can't subdivide a smaller unit into larger units. Returns empty array to signal inability.

**Date:** October 15, 2025 (Late Afternoon)
**Decision:** Precondition failures for invalid period parameters
**Rationale:** Programming errors (month 13, quarter 5) should fail fast at development time, not silently produce incorrect data.

**Date:** October 15, 2025 (Late Afternoon)
**Decision:** Type-first comparison: daily < monthly < quarterly < annual, then by date
**Rationale:** Provides consistent sorting behavior. All daily periods sort before monthly, etc. Within same type, chronological order applies. Enables predictable time series operations.

**Date:** October 15, 2025 (Late Evening)
**Decision:** MonthDay uses preconditions instead of throwing errors for validation
**Rationale:** Consistent with Period design. Invalid month/day values (month 13, day 32) are programming errors that should fail fast during development, not runtime errors to handle. Simplifies API by removing `try` requirement.

### Open Questions

1. **Missing value handling**: Should TimeSeries subscript return `Optional<T>` or throw?
   - Current: Return `Optional<T>`
   - Alternative: Throw custom error
   - Decision: TBD

2. **Period arithmetic across fiscal years**: How should this work?
   - Current: Calendar-based
   - Alternative: Fiscal-aware
   - Decision: TBD

3. **Performance optimization**: When to implement lazy evaluation?
   - Current: Eager evaluation
   - Future: Consider lazy for large datasets
   - Decision: Defer to performance testing
