## üéØ Project Overview

### Goal
Build a comprehensive Time Series and Temporal Framework to enable financial projection models (P&L, Balance Sheet, Cash Flow statements) with statistical rigor.

### Current Status
**Phase:** Planning Complete ‚úÖ
**Implementation:** Not Started ‚¨ú

---

## üì¶ What We're Building

### Phase 1: Core Temporal Structures
Foundation for working with time periods in financial models.
- `PeriodType` enum (daily, monthly, quarterly, annual)
- `Period` struct (type-safe time periods)
- Period arithmetic (add, subtract, ranges)
- `FiscalCalendar` (support for fiscal years)

### Phase 2: Time Series Container
Data structure for time-based financial data.
- `TimeSeries<T>` generic container
- Transformations (map, filter, reduce)
- Missing value handling (fill, interpolate)
- Aggregation (monthly ‚Üí quarterly ‚Üí annual)
- Analytics (growth rates, moving averages)

### Phase 3: Time Value of Money
Essential financial calculations.
- Present/Future Value
- Annuity calculations
- Loan payments and amortization
- NPV (Net Present Value)
- IRR (Internal Rate of Return)
- MIRR, XIRR, XNPV

### Phase 4: Growth & Trend Models
Forecasting and projection tools.
- Growth rate calculations (simple, CAGR)
- Trend models (linear, exponential, logistic)
- Seasonality analysis and adjustment
- Time series decomposition

### Phase 5: Testing & Documentation
Comprehensive quality assurance.
- Unit tests with Swift Testing framework
- Integration tests
- Performance benchmarks
- DocC documentation catalog

## üöÄ Getting Started

### For Your Next Session

1. **Review the Master Plan** ([00_MASTER_PLAN.md](00_MASTER_PLAN.md))
   - Understand the overall architecture
   - See the initial user request and context

2. **Check Coding Rules** ([01_CODING_RULES.md](01_CODING_RULES.md))
   - Refresh on Swift Testing syntax
   - Review DocC documentation patterns
   - Note the generic `<T: Real>` pattern

3. **Reference Usage Examples** ([02_USAGE_EXAMPLES.md](02_USAGE_EXAMPLES.md))
   - See how the API should work
   - Understand real-world use cases
   - Use for test inspiration

4. **Open the Checklist** ([04_IMPLEMENTATION_CHECKLIST.md](04_IMPLEMENTATION_CHECKLIST.md))
   - Find the next uncompleted task
   - Mark items as you complete them
   - Track your progress

5. **Start Implementing!**
   - Recommended start: Phase 1.1 (PeriodType)
   - Write tests first (TDD approach)
   - Document as you go (DocC format)

---

## üìä Implementation Strategy

### Recommended Order
1. **PeriodType** ‚Üí Simple enum, no dependencies
2. **Period** ‚Üí Builds on PeriodType
3. **Period Arithmetic** ‚Üí Extends Period functionality
4. **FiscalCalendar** ‚Üí Independent, can be done in parallel
5. **TimeSeries** ‚Üí Requires Period to be complete
6. **TimeSeries Operations** ‚Üí Builds on TimeSeries
7. **Time Value of Money** ‚Üí Can start after basic TimeSeries
8. **Growth & Trends** ‚Üí Requires TimeSeries analytics

### Test-Driven Development
For each component:
1. ‚úçÔ∏è Write tests first (define expected behavior)
2. üî® Implement to make tests pass
3. üìù Write DocC documentation
4. ‚úÖ Mark checklist items complete
5. üîÑ Refactor if needed

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Technologies

- **Language:** Swift 6.0
- **Testing:** Swift Testing framework (`@Test`, `#expect`)
- **Documentation:** DocC (triple-slash comments + articles)
- **Numerics:** swift-numerics (Real protocol)
- **Concurrency:** StrictConcurrency enabled

---

## üìö Important Patterns

### Generic Real Types
```swift
public func mean<T: Real>(_ x: [T]) -> T {
    guard x.count > 0 else { return T(0) }
    return (x.reduce(T(0), +) / T(x.count))
}
```

### Swift Testing
```swift
import Testing
@testable import BusinessMath

@Suite("Period Tests")
struct PeriodTests {
    @Test("Create monthly period")
    func createMonth() {
        let jan = Period.month(year: 2025, month: 1)
        #expect(jan.type == .monthly)
    }
}
```

### DocC Documentation
```swift
/// Calculate the net present value of cash flows.
///
/// NPV discounts future cash flows to their present value using
/// a specified discount rate.
///
/// - Parameters:
///   - discountRate: The rate to discount cash flows (e.g., 0.10 for 10%).
///   - cashFlows: Array of cash flows. First is typically negative (investment).
///
/// - Returns: The net present value. Positive NPV indicates value creation.
///
/// ## Excel Equivalent
/// Equivalent to `NPV(rate, value1, [value2], ...)`
///
/// ## Usage Example
/// ```swift
/// let flows = [-100000.0, 30000.0, 30000.0, 30000.0]
/// let npv = npv(discountRate: 0.10, cashFlows: flows)
/// ```
public func npv<T: Real>(discountRate r: T, cashFlows c: [T]) -> T
```

## üéì Learning Resources

### Swift Testing
- [Swift Testing Documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing)
- Uses `@Test` instead of `func test...`
- Uses `#expect` instead of `XCTAssert`

### DocC
- [Apple DocC Guide](https://www.swift.org/documentation/docc/)
- Build with: `swift package generate-documentation`
- Preview with: `swift package --disable-sandbox preview-documentation`

### Swift Numerics
- [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/apple/swift-numerics)
- Provides `Real` protocol for generic numeric programming

## üîç Context for Future Sessions

### Why This Exists
You (the developer) asked for help building financial projection models in Swift. The existing BusinessMath library has strong statistical and probability foundations, but lacks time series and financial statement capabilities.

This documentation set was created to maintain context across multiple sessions, as you mentioned this would happen "over a period of days" and context might be lost.

### The Initial Vision
The end goal is to build:
1. **Time Series** (current focus)
2. **Operational Drivers** (units, customers, costs)
3. **Financial Statements** (P&L, Balance Sheet, Cash Flow)
4. **Scenario Analysis** (Monte Carlo, sensitivity)
5. **Financial Metrics** (ratios, valuation)
...and more (see Master Plan for full roadmap)

### Design Decisions Made
- Use Swift Testing (modern, cross-platform)
- Use DocC (first-party, excellent integration)
- Generic over `Real` (flexibility across numeric types)
- Immutable operations (functional style)
- Period-based (not just raw dates)
- Type-safe (Period types prevent errors)
