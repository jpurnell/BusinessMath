Phase 5: Testing & Documentation

  5.1 Test Structure

  Tests/BusinessMathTests/Time Series Tests/
  ├── Period Tests.swift
  ├── TimeSeries Tests.swift
  ├── TVM Tests.swift (PV, FV, PMT, IRR, MIRR, NPV)
  ├── Growth Tests.swift
  └── Integration Tests.swift

  Test Coverage:
  - Edge cases: empty series, single period, missing values
  - Known financial math results (Excel equivalents)
  - Period arithmetic boundary conditions (month-end, leap years)
  - Fiscal calendar scenarios
  - Growth rate special cases (negative growth, zero values)

  5.2 Documentation Examples

  Each module should include:
  - Standalone usage examples
  - Integration examples (combining multiple features)
  - Real-world scenarios (loan amortization, revenue projection)
  - Performance characteristics
